The app that i created was a simple hangman game. To run this app you just have to use the command:

python HangmanGame.py

OR if you are pulling the docker image you can run it via:

docker run -it nizrab/alir0003_assignment_4

--- The -it flag makes the console interactive so you will able to play via the docker image. ---

The game gives you 6 attempts to gess the correct letter until you get the word. The program catches if
the letter has already been used and also will catch numbers or inccorect inputs.
